Sup Sup this is my first project Ive done in my own free time

The text file TestSpells.txt is the important file needed, without it, the program is unable to run.

On first run it will generate the rest of the files as needed.

If You want to add your own spells the format is like this

[Name]
[If cantrip:*Type Of Cantrip* cantrip][If Spell:*1st/2nd/ect-level* *Type of Spell*]
[Range: *insert range here* feet]
[Components: *Put type of components in by first letter i.e. V, S
[Duration: *Put the duration here]
[Description: *put description here*]
Here is an example:
Acid Splash
Conjuration cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S

You hurl a bubble of acid. Choose one creature within range, or choose two creatures within range that are within 5 feet of each other. A target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 acid damage. This spellâ€™s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).
